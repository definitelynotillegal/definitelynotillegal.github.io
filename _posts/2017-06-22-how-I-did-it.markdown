This section just explains how I created the website in somewhat advanced computer terms, if you are not a very tech savvy person, the majority of this will fly over your head.

 
To start I downloaded jekyll with the command line and created a static site, I then created a repo on github. After that I used a bash file on codeacademy with the jekyll gem to rename the repo to the website's soon-to-be domain name. Finally I pushed the unedited static site with default jekyll format to the github repo, wich made github host the site.

 
Now I'm using this website to learn the basics of jekyll and github, as well as using it to touch up my html5 with css.
