 +Hello! If you have found this site you are likely someone I know, however, even if you are not a friend/family member of mine, I still welcome you to my site! As you will see printed many times here, this site is my first public website, and will be used mainly for experimentation and educational purposes. This website won't be too interesting, but feel free to check out whatever various updates and posts I add to the website.
