 +This website is my gift to my wonderful girlfriend, Sarah. This is a Christmas gift, but I'll try to keep seasonal aspects to a minimum. I'm going to be honest with you this was a little too difficult for me, I screwed up somewhere early on and I had to fix a lot of problems one by one because of it, but the website is here and now you can proudly say: "Yeah my boyfriend's a total knerd."
